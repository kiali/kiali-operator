The files in this directory are used for the link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/make/Makefile.operator.mk[`make run-operator-playbook` target]. Configure these files to tell the operator playbook what to do when that target is executed.

* `dev-hosts.yaml` - the Ansible inventory file. This should contain variables that the operator SDK would normally set when triggering an operator reconciliation run. Note that most of the values here will be values that mimic the values in the Kiali CR. You typically will want to make sure the values in `dev-kiali-cr.yaml` match those in this `dev-hosts.yaml` file.

* `dev-kiali-cr.yaml` - the "dummy" Kiali CR that will be created. This is needed because the operator will sometimes need to access the Kiali CR that is being reconciled, so one needs to be created in the cluster for the operator to run correctly. In particular, the operator will update the `status` field of the Kiali CR.

* `dev-playbook.yaml` - the main playbook that will be run. By default it will run the `kiali-deploy` playbook (which will install a Kiali server) and then immediately run the `kiali-remove` playbook (which will uninstall that Kiali server). You can comment out one or the other if you wish to test just one of those playbooks.
