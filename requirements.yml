# This is the Ansible collection requirements that need to be installed locally to be able to run
# the operator Ansible playbook locally. Collections are sourced from GitHub to avoid Galaxy outages.
#
# To install these into your local Ansible environment:
#   ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml --force-with-deps
#
# Make sure these collections match that which is inside the downstream Ansible Operator SDK base image.
# You can determine what collections are installed by looking in the base image like this:
#
# podman run \
#   -it --rm --entrypoint '' \
#   registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-ansible-rhel9-operator:v4.19 \
#   ansible-galaxy collection list
#
# NOTE: for older base images, ansible-galaxy had no "collection list" command; instead, run the command:
#   ls /opt/ansible/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections
#
# To determine the version of a specific collection
#
# podman run \
#   -it --rm --entrypoint '' \
#   registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-ansible-rhel9-operator:v4.19 \
#   ansible-galaxy collection list kubernetes.core
#
# NOTE: for older base images, ansible-galaxy had no "collection list" command; instead, look at the MANIFEST.json:
#   cat /opt/ansible/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/kubernetes/core/MANIFEST.json | grep version
#
# It is best if you have the same version of Ansible installed locally as found in the base image. You can determine
# the version of Ansible in the base image via:
#
# podman run \
#   -it --rm --entrypoint '' \
#   registry.redhat.io/openshift4/ose-ansible-rhel9-operator:v4.19 \
#   ansible --version
#
# To install that version locally, you can git clone the source via:
#   git clone -b v<ansible version> --depth 1 https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
# and then set up your environment via:
#   source ./ansible/hacking/env-setup -q
