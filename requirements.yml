# This is the Ansible Galaxy requirements that need to be installed locally to be able to run
# the operator Ansible playbook locally.
#
# To install these into your local Ansible environment:
#   ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml --force-with-deps
#
# Make sure these collections match that which is inside the Ansible Operator SDK base image.
# You can determine what collections are installed by looking in the base image like this:
#
# podman run \
#   -it --rm --entrypoint '' \
#   quay.io/openshift/origin-ansible-operator:4.8 \
#   ls /opt/ansible/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections
#
# To determine the version of a specific collection, look at the MANIFEST.json:
#
# podman run \
#   -it --rm --entrypoint '' \
#   quay.io/openshift/origin-ansible-operator:4.8 \
#   cat /opt/ansible/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/community/kubernetes/MANIFEST.json | grep version
