                  The version of the Ansible playbook to execute in order to install that version of OSSM Console.
                  It is rare you will want to set this - if you are thinking of setting this, know what you are doing first.
                  The only supported value today is `default`.

                  If not specified, a default version of OSSMC will be installed which will be the most recent release of OSSMC.
                  Refer to this file to see where these values are defined in the master branch,
                  https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/playbooks/ossmconsole-default-supported-images.yml

                  This version setting affects the defaults of the deployment.imageName and
                  deployment.imageVersion settings. See the comments for those settings
                  below for additional details. But in short, this version setting will
                  dictate which version of the OSSM Console image will be deployed by default.
                  Note that if you explicitly set deployment.imageName and/or
                  deployment.imageVersion you are responsible for ensuring those settings
                  are compatible with this setting (i.e. the image must be compatible
                  with the rest of the configuration and resources the operator will install).

Note that, as a security measure, a cluster admin may have configured the OSSM Console operator to ignore this setting. A cluster admin may do this to ensure the OSSM Console operator only installs a single, specific OSSM Console version, thus this setting may have no effect depending on how the operator itself was configured."

                      Determines which version of OSSM Console to install.
                      Choose 'lastrelease' to use the last OSSM Console release.
                      Choose 'latest' to use the latest image (which may or may not be a released version of the OSSM Console).
                      Choose 'operator_version' to use the image whose version is the same as the operator version.
                      Otherwise, you can set this to any valid OSSM Console version (such as 'v1.0') or any valid OSSM Console
                      digest hash (if you set this to a digest hash, you must indicate the digest in `deployment.imageDigest`).
                      Note that if this is set to 'latest' then the `deployment.imagePullPolicy` will be set to 'Always'.
                      If you set this to a specific version (i.e. you do not leave it as the default empty string),
                      you must make sure that image is supported by the operator.
                      If empty, the operator will use a known supported image version based on which 'version' was defined.
                      Note that, as a security measure, a cluster admin may have configured the OSSM Console operator to

                      operator itself was configured.
