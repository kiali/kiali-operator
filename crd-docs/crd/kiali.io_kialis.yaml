                  A list of additional details that Kiali will look for in annotations. When found on any workload or service, Kiali will display the additional details in the respective workload or service details page. This is typically used to inject some CI metadata or documentation links into Kiali views. For example, by default, Kiali will recognize these annotations on a service or workload (e.g. a Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.):
                  ```
                  annotations:
                    kiali.io/api-spec: http://list/to/my/api/doc
                    kiali.io/api-type: rest
                  ```
                  Note that if you change this setting for your own custom annotations, keep in mind that it would override the current default. So you would have to add the default setting as shown in the example CR if you want to preserve the default links.

                  It is rare you will want to set this - if you are thinking of setting this, know what you are doing first.
                  The only supported value today is `default`.

                  If not specified, a default version of Kiali will be installed which will be the most recent release of Kiali.
                  Refer to this file to see where these values are defined in the master branch,
                  https://github.com/kiali/kiali-operator/blob/master/playbooks/kiali-default-supported-images.yml

                  This version setting affects the defaults of the deployment.image_name and
                  deployment.image_version settings. See the comments for those settings
                  below for additional details. But in short, this version setting will
                  dictate which version of the Kiali image will be deployed by default.
                  Note that if you explicitly set deployment.image_name and/or
                  deployment.image_version you are responsible for ensuring those settings
                  are compatible with this setting (i.e. the Kiali image must be compatible
                  with the rest of the configuration and resources the operator will install).

                          then the Kiali operator will add a new label to all accessible namespaces - that new
                          label will be this `label_selector_include` (this label is added regardless if the namespace matches the label_selector_exclude also).

                          Note that if you do not set this `label_selector_include` setting but `deployment.accessible_namespaces`
                          does not have the special "all namespaces" entry of `'**'` then this `label_selector_include` will be set

                      Options are `anonymous`, `token`, `openshift`, `openid`, or `header`.

                      * Choose `anonymous` to allow full access to Kiali without requiring any credentials.
                      * Choose `token` to allow access to Kiali using service account tokens, which controls
                      access based on RBAC roles assigned to the service account.
                      * Choose `openshift` to use the OpenShift OAuth login which controls access based on
                      the individual's RBAC roles in OpenShift. Not valid for non-OpenShift environments.
                      * Choose `openid` to enable OpenID Connect-based authentication. Your cluster is required to
                      be configured to accept the tokens issued by your IdP. There are additional required
                      configurations for this strategy. See below for the additional OpenID configuration section.
                      * Choose `header` when Kiali is running behind a reverse proxy that will inject an
                      Authorization header and potentially impersonation headers.

                      When empty, this value will default to `openshift` on OpenShift and `token` on other Kubernetes environments.

                  with the same name as a built-in dashboard, your custom dashboard takes precedence and will overwrite
                  the built-in dashboard. You can disable one or more of the built-in dashboards by simply defining an
                  empty dashboard.

                  These external service configuration settings define how to connect to the external services
                  like Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger.

                  Regarding sensitive values in the external_services 'auth' sections:
                  Some external services configured below support an 'auth' sub-section in order to tell Kiali
                  how it should authenticate with the external services. Credentials used to authenticate Kiali
                  to those external services can be defined in the `auth.password` and `auth.token` values
                  within the `auth` sub-section. Because these are sensitive values, you may not want to declare
                  the actual credentials here in the Kiali CR. In this case, you may store the actual password
                  or token string in a Kubernetes secret. If you do, you need to set the `auth.password` or
                  `auth.token` to a value in the format `secret:<secretName>:<secretKey>` where `<secretName>`
                  is the name of the secret object that Kiali can access, and `<secretKey>` is the name of the
                  key within the named secret that contains the actual password or token string. For example,
                  if Grafana requires a password, you can store that password in a secret named 'myGrafanaCredentials'
                  in a key named 'myGrafanaPw'. In this case, you would set `external_services.grafana.auth.password`
                  to `secret:myGrafanaCredentials:myGrafanaPw`.
