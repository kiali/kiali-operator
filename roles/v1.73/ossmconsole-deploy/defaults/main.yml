# Defaults for all user-facing OSSM Console settings.
#
# Note that these are under the main dictionary group "ossmconsole_defaults".
# The actual vars used by the role are found in the vars/ directory.
# These defaults (the dictionaries under "ossmconsole_defaults") are merged into the vars such that the values
# below (e.g. deployment) are merged in rather than completely replaced by user-supplied values.
#
# If new groups are added to these defaults, you must remember to add the merge code to vars/main.yml.
